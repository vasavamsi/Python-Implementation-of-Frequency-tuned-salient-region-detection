Code for Course Project 
>>>Frequency tuned salient region Detection

>> Instructions to run the code:
> Open test_script.py
> Change the input image no. (mentioned in the code) 
> Save and run the script.
> All the images (i.e final segmented image and the intermediate images) are saved in the
results folder.

> To run the algorithm on the image other than given images, copy the images in the dataset
folder and change the name of the input image in the code.

>> Note:
> 10 images are provided in the 'dataset' folder.
> Here the threshold for the fixed threshold segmentation can be varied (mentioned in
test_script.py)
> The threshold for the mean shift segmentation can be varied. (mentioned in test_script.py)
> The k factor for the final segmentation with adaptive thresholding can be varied (mentioned in
test_script.py)
> For switching the final binary mask, the values 255 and 0 are to be interchanged (mentioned
in final_segmentation.py)
